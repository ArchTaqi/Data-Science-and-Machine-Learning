    "1. **Questions**  The accuracy of data analysis relies on the quality of data that has been collected. A number of errors can occur while collecting data. Manual error is the major one. Regardless of the amount of information and data science expertise we have, machine learning may be useless or even harmful with poor data collection process in place. **Tip for Questions** ask and analyze each and every aspect to things related to the object from his birth to death. i.e In analysics prices of car, gather all information related to car [color, milage, capicity, resale] from the birth of car till it is destroyed.\n",
